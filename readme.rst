Most notes here were wrote with the old **ipython-notebook** (before the whole Jupyter movement).

That was when I first began to learn python. Back then, I had a luke-warm feeling about ipython-notebook, and preferred to use Anaconda Spyder environment. Getting my hands wet with jupyter-notebook after a few months hiatus, I was pleasantly surprised on the amount of improvement they made (*e..g.*, integration with R with magic-cell, hyper-linked TOC that makes code navigation smoother).

I probably will use this more often when trying to acclimate myself with new python packages and web APIs.

TOC for hosting on jupyter notebook
***********************************
When ready to host the code on nbviewer, insert below as a markdown cell (this will destroy the TOC on the right-sidebar in jupyter, but will create a nice auto-generated TOC at the top of the notebook).

- ``%%!``: run cell body with the underlying OS shell; this is similar to prefixing every line in the cell with ``!``.
- ``%%bash``: run cell body under bash.
- ``%%capture``: capture the output of the code in the cell (and stderr as well). Useful to run codes that produce too much output that you donâ€™t even want scrolled.
- ``%%file``: save cell body as a file.
- ``%%perl``: run cell body using Perl.
- ``%%prun``: run cell body with profiler (cell extension of ``%prun``).
- ``%%python3``: run cell body using Python 3.
- ``%%ruby``: run cell body using Ruby.
- ``%%script``: run cell body with the script specified in the first line.
- ``%%sh``: run cell body using sh.
- ``%%sx``: run cell with system shell and capture process output (cell extension of ``%sx``).
- ``%%system``: run cell with system shell (``%%!`` is an alias to this).
- ``%%timeit``: time the execution of the cell (extension of ``%timeit``).

Enable ``toggle`` code
**********************
Insert the following in code cells:

.. code-block:: python

    from IPython.display import HTML

    HTML('''<script>
    code_show=true;
    function code_toggle() {
     if (code_show){
     $('div.input').hide();
     } else {
     $('div.input').show();
     }
     code_show = !code_show
    }
    $( document ).ready(code_toggle);
    </script>
    <form action="javascript:code_toggle()"><input type="submit" value="Click here to toggle on/off the raw code."></form>''')
