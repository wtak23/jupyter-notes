Personally not a huge fan of this ORM idea for both practical and pedagogical reason.

I like to keep the SQL side and the Python side of my code separate.

Maybe in the future I'll find the ORM idea more appropriate, but I'll stick with connecting to sqlite3 and mysql engine, and executing SQL commands using SQL coding constructs.
